# HEVC_deblock_FIilter_RAMP
unofficial implement for Paper "HEVC-BASED DEBLOCKING FILTER WITH RAMP PRESERVATION PROPERTIES "
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7025744/

My implement is based on Official HM.16.15(Windows10 Visual Studio) and I just modified the deblockFilter part according to the paper I refered above.
So if you want to implement it in other HM version, my advice is to use TortoiseSVN to download HM softwares with the url(https://hevc.hhi.fraunhofer.de/svn/svn_HEVCSoftware/tags/), and right click on "check out" to download the version you like.
